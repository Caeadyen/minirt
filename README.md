# minirt

Based on the minirt Project in 42

as i don't need to turn this in and evaluate it, i break some rules for 42\
also will not add additionally feature as bonus

Rules that are broken:

Norm (mostly the to many function in a file, so i keep function on the same thing together)\
MLX42 using this library (as submodule)\
Error handling, there is some but you can easy crash the program atm

Feature:

Ambiete Light\
Light source (single) with light color\
Camera

objects to add:

Plane\
Sphere\
Cylinder

work in progress, so will add new features from time to time
